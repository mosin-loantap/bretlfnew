# Product Rules API Documentation

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

The Product Rules API has been successfully moved from the routes file to the BREController as requested.

### API Endpoint
```
POST /api/bre/product-rules
```

### Location
**Controller**: `app/Http/Controllers/BREController.php`
**Method**: `getProductRules(Request $request)`
**Routes**: `routes/api.php` (clean route definition only)

### Request Format
```json
{
    "partner_id": 1,
    "product_name": "Personal Loan"
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Product rules retrieved successfully",
    "partner": "Loantap",
    "product": "Personal Loan",
    "rules_count": 4,
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "rule_name": "Final Test Rule",
            "description": null,

                {
                    "id": 3,
                    "variable_name": "salary",
                    "operator": "greater_than_or_equal",
                    "value": "20000"
                }
            ],
            "actions": []
        }
    ]
}
```

### Key Features
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Logic moved to BREController, routes file only contains route definitions
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Validates partner_id exists and product_name is provided
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ **Logging**: Debug logs for troubleshooting and monitoring
- ✅ **Relationship Loading**: Eager loads conditions and actions for complete rule data
- ✅ **Proper Response Format**: Consistent JSON structure with success indicators

### Changes Made
1. **Fixed Constructor**: Made RuleEvaluationService dependency optional to resolve injection issues
2. **Updated getProductRules Method**: Replaced with working implementation that handles proper database column names
3. **Cleaned Routes File**: Removed inline closure functions, kept only clean route definitions
4. **Working API**: Tested and confirmed to return complete rule data with conditions and actions

### Database Column Mappings
- **Partners**: Uses `partner_id` as primary key, `nbfc_name` for name
- **Products**: Uses `product_id` as primary key, `product_name` for name  
- **Rules**: Uses `rule_id` as primary key
- **Conditions**: Uses `condition_id` as primary key
- **Actions**: Uses `action_id` as primary key

The API is now properly structured with business logic in the controller and clean route definitions in the routes file.
